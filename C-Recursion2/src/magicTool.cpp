/*

	Given a matrix nxn and a starting point (p,q), 
	Output all the points in the matrix which are identical to the starting point in the fashion similar to magic tool in Adobe photoshop.
	Eg:
	(p,q) : (0,3)
	1 2 3 3
	3 2 3 3
	5 3 3 3
	4 5 1 4
	o/p : [ (0,2) (0,3) (1,2) (1,3) (2,2) (2,3) (2,1) ]

	Use 2 structures provided to solve the problem.
	
	struct point -> contains x, y corresponding to point on matrix.
	struct result -> contains 3 fields
						1. selected -> contains all the final points after the selecting process.
						2. size -> number of the selected points.
						3. visited -> utility variable to note the visited points on matrix during recursion.
	
	In error cases return a emply structures
		size = 0;
		selected = {};
		visited = {};

NOTE : Donot use any Global Variables
